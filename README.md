Purpose of the Project_: Build machine learning models and ask business questions
Subject: Green roofs in New York City

Business Questions:

	As a green roof company, that makes only materials supply, the CEO want possible answers and analysis to make  data driven decisions like:
	
		1. Wich areas of the city it will be good to invest in the future (can be analysed as neighborhood or district);
		
		2. Wich type of buildings the company will get more profit and were they will be constructed? (buildings that seems to likely have largest green areas);
		
		3. Buildings with more height are going to be a good investment ?: tall buildings will have much more expensive logistic 
		operations (delivering materials) . So if this is not a factor with significant influence for the a building to have a green roof, maybe the company don't want to do to much effort on investing or promoting his products to clients with these type of buildings
		
		4.	To see if it would be a good investment to purchase a software to make digitised roofs


ML models:

	1. Regression models: predicting green roof area and to have some insights about the factors that most influence the area of green roof
	
	2. Clustering models: grouping buildings to try to discover some unseen insights of data or trends like in the year of construction, districts, neighborhood
	
	3. Classification models: to know if a building had been digitised or not
